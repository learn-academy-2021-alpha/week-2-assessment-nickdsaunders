3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to display "Hello World" in the browser?

  Your answer: You would need a render(), return(), and opening and closing tags <></>

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting has something to do with being able to declare variables after a function and the code still being able to pull the information up.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods - each component has several lifecycle methods thay you can override to run code at particular times in the process.

- React props - keyword in React for passing information from one component to another. Props are only passed in one direction from parent to child. Props cannot be updated, they are "read only"

- event.preventDefault() - method that tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taked as it normally would be.

- DOM events - Interactions with a user such as clicking with thier mouse, hover over elements, or using their keyboard to type.

- MVC - Model View Controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
